# Karabiner_Kill_CMD-W_in_Emacs

For Karabiner OSX key remapping software. 

This key remap only works inside of Emacs. To change that, get rid of the "only" tags. 

To use, go to Karabiner Preferences > Misc & Uninstall, select Custom Setting > open private.xml, and paste or switch with this file. 

In Karabiner, go back to "Change Key" and select "Reload XML".

Select "Swap Command + w and Control + ` in Emacs".

Voil√†, CMD-W hell is terminated.
